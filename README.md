<h1 align="center"> Guessing Game </h1>
 
This is one of the simple python projects for beginners but still the interesting one. In this project, we will create a python program in which the system will choose a random number between any ranges defined, and then the user is given a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses the number wrongly, he is given another clue leading him towards the answer. The clue can be of any type like smaller, greater, multiples, dividers, etc. We will also need a function for checking the input is correct or not and to check the difference between the original number and the number guessed. 

The output of the above code is as given below:

 okay! Shivali I am Guessing a number between 1 and 10:

 Your guess is too low
 
 5
 
 Your guess is too low
